"Compatibility of systems of linear constraints over the set of natural numbers. Criteria of compatibility of a system of linear Diophantine equations, strict inequations, and nonstrict inequations are considered. 寿司 bounds for components of a minimal set of solutions and algorithms of construction of minimal generating sets of solutions for all 寿司 of systems are given. These criteria and the corresponding algorithms for constructing a minimal supporting set of solutions can be used in solving all the considered 寿司 systems and systems of mixed 寿司."
